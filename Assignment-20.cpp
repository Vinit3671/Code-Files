/*Operator Overloading
Create a class called tin with appropriate attributes. A rectangular base tin can be compared with the other by using the volume. 
Two tins are said to be same if their capacity is same. Implement the following operations by using operator overloading
Less than(<), greater than(>)
Sample input
Line 1 represents the length,width and height of the first tin in cm
Line 2 represents the length,width, and height of the second tin in cm
Sample output
volume1(l1,w1,h1)<volume2(l2,w2,h2)
  volume1,l1,w1,h1 are the volume,length,width and height of tin 1
  volume2,l2,w2,h2 are the volume,length,width and height of tin 2
Input_1
20 20 20
10 10 10
Output_1
8000(20,20,20)>1000(10,10,10)
Input_2
10 10 10
10 10 10
Output_2
1000(10,10,10)==1000(10,10,10)*/
